## Self narrative report

** What was your programming objective when you started? **
In general, I selected a Scientific Programming course to enhance my coding and
data analysis skills. Data science, for me, is quite demanding, especially in 
comprehending data structures, interpreting the physical significance of the 
output, and determining how to access it within the code.
I have some programming experience from my bachelor's, though not in great detail.
I am focused on improving my knowledge, particularly through self-directed learning.
Understanding how to enhance my skills is a key aspect of my learning journey.

** What task was assigned to you when you started? **
Our group initially lacked clear direction, but within a few days, we successfully 
gathered our thoughts. During our discussion with Manuela Lenher, we decided 
to concentrate on developing a package for aviation. This package will collate 
horizontal cross-sections, windroses, Hovmuller and SkewT diagrams, incorporating 
the topography and time series features from the original package.

** What changed during the implementation, that is, what is the outcome of the project? **
Not much changed during the implementation phase. I opted to incorporate some 
enhancements in the command and HTML output layout. Each member of the group 
successfully completed their assigned tasks and even went beyond what was 
initially chosen at the beginning of the project.

** What was the biggest challenge you faced in the implementation? **
When I first encountered the package, everything seemed quite confusing. 
However, over time, I began to grasp its functionality, particularly when I delved 
into setting it up and using input commands.
I successfully implemented the [horizontal cross-section] and, in the process, 
had to navigate through data structures. I must admit it was a bit challenging 
for me, and I felt frustrated initially. However, with patience and time, 
I eventually understood the structure and learned how to access the data within 
the netCDF WRF output dataset.
The initial implementation worked well and comprised two functions. The first 
function accesses the data and returns a dataset containing the values of a 
user-selected variable for all latitudes at a fixed time and grid level. 
The second function plots the dataset returned by the first function.
But the most challenging implementation was the extraction of the variable at
same geopotential hight and actually the function does not works and unfortunately
.....

** What was the biggest challenge when merging everyoneâ€™s work into one package? **
I successfully merged all the components of the package, incorporating some valuable 
suggestions from my group members. I made this decision as I believed my task was 
comparatively easier than the others within my group. Although it presented its 
challenges, I found it more manageable than accessing the data directly. 
Consequently, I introduced a new command line that functions well. Additionally, 
I designed new HTML structures to organize the output figures from the modules, 
ensuring a meaningful and coherent structure.
